# Lab 1: Artemis Setup
The objective of this lab is to setup the Artemis test and basic functions using Arduino IDE. The lab consists of 4 poritons: blink the on-board LED, read/write serial messages over USB, display the output from the onboard temperature sensor, and measure the loudest frequency recorded by the Pulse Density Microphone.

## Blink it Up
Upon first try of running the example code, I got gibberish out of the serial terminal. Upon closer look, I needed to adjust the baud rate. I set the data rate to 11520 baud.
